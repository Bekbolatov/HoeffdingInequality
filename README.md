Codes for the exercise 1.10 in book "Learning from Data" by Yaser Abu-Mostafa.
Experiment shows a "uniform" version of Hoeffding's inequality with a non-trivial hypothesis set.

Obviously this is an overkill - it creates a more general framework for running experiments.
Real purposes are:
 [1] practicing writing projects with GitHub
 [2] better digest Machine Learning and statistics constructs

It is far from being optimal, and in fact, I am also including a couple of Octave scripts to do the same things more efficiently.
They can be found in the folder "octave" and running them will produce histograms.
